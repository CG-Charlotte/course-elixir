# What's elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.


## Functional Programming

Functional programming promotes a coding style that helps developers write code that is short, fast, and maintainable. For example, pattern matching allows developers to easily destructure data and access its contents:

```erlang
%User{name: name, age: age} = User.get("John Doe")
name #=> "John Doe"
```
